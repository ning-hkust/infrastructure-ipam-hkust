/**
 * Expressions are used in Randoop to record observations about the execution of
 * a statement sequence. See randoop.Observation.
 * 
 * A randoop Expression is much like a regular Java expression: it denotes some
 * computation that produces a value. Typically, the expression is over a
 * collection of values. For example, the expression "o1.equals(o2)" is an
 * expression over the values o1 and o2 and produces a boolean value.
 * 
 * An implementing class should ensure that:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> A call to evaluate() returns null, a primitive value, or a String.
 * <li> The implementing class declares a constructor with zero parameters.
 * </ul>
